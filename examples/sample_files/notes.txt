Find File Type (fft) - Development Notes
==========================================

This is a plain text file used for testing the fft tool's file type detection capabilities.

Features to implement:
- Filesystem tests: Check file extensions, permissions, and attributes
- Magic tests: Analyze file signatures and magic bytes
- Language tests: Pattern matching for programming languages

Common file types to support:
- Programming languages: Python, JavaScript, Java, C/C++, etc.
- Documents: PDF, Word, Excel, PowerPoint, text files
- Images: JPEG, PNG, GIF, SVG, TIFF, BMP
- Audio/Video: MP3, MP4, AVI, WAV, FLAC
- Archives: ZIP, TAR, GZIP, RAR, 7-Zip
- Data formats: JSON, XML, CSV, YAML

Test cases:
1. Files with standard extensions
2. Files without extensions
3. Files with misleading extensions
4. Binary files
5. Empty files
6. Directories
7. Symbolic links

Performance considerations:
- Limit file reading to prevent memory issues with large files
- Use efficient regex patterns for language detection
- Cache results when possible
- Handle encoding issues gracefully

This tool should be fast, accurate, and reliable for everyday use.
